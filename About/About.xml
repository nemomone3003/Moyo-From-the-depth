Moyo-From the depth
	
A strange-humanlike figure with tail and pale blue skin rise from the beach, the Moyos have arrived to the surface.
The descendants of a glitterworld wanderlusts, who saw the depth of the ocean an ideal place for habitation.
Years and years of modification, so long that they have forgotten their origins now recides in the depth of the rimworld, Striving in their arcology called the 'lighthouse'.
	
Recently, Moyos have discovered a particular substance from their body. Named 'Deep blue', it originates form the constand modifications their ancesters had.
This made a massive impact on thier society. Having many opportunities in medical purposes, some Moyos saw it as an opprtunity for a fortune - Maybe you too.
